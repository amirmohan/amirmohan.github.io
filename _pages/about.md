I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I serve as program faculty for the [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd), [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu), and [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu) Ph.D. programs. I am also affiliated with the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) and the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu) and [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), and earned my Ph.D. at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of <b>machine learning and AI</b>, <b>signal and information processing</b>, and <b>biological design and engineering</b>. I develop principled algorithms and theoretical tools for building scalable, interpretable, and design-oriented AI systems, with a focus on understanding and engineering biological function. Current research directions are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundations of Machine Learning:</strong> Fast inference, diffusion and generative models, and high-dimensional statistical learning</li>
<li><strong>AI Safety and Interpretability:</strong> Mechanistic interpretability and reasoning, Fourier-based explanation methods</li>
<li><strong>AI for Science:</strong> Protein design, sequence-function maps, cryo-EM modeling, and computational studies of the origins of life</li>
</ul>
