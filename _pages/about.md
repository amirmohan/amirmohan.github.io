I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I serve as program faculty for the Ph.D. programs in [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd), [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu), and [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu), and am affiliated with the [IDEaS](https://research.gatech.edu/data), [IMS](https://matter-systems.gatech.edu), and [Petit Institute (IBB)](https://research.gatech.edu/bio).

Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu) and [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), and earned my Ph.D. at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). My research group develops principled algorithms and theoretical tools for building scalable, interpretable, and design-oriented AI systems, with a core focus on understanding and engineering biological functions.

Current research directions are:

<ul>
<li><strong>Foundations of ML and Gen AI:</strong> Diffusion models, accelerating model inference, and high-dimensional statistical learning</li>

<li><strong>Mechanistic AI, Reasoning, and Safety:</strong> Interpretability, circuit-level analysis, verification, and Fourier-based explanation methods</li>

<li><strong> (Agentic) AI for Discovery and Bioengineering:</strong> Autonomous hypothesis generation, protein design and optimization, sequence–function modeling, cryo-EM, and origins-of-life studies</li>
</ul>

I pronounce my first name <strong>Ah-meer-ah-lee</strong> and my last name <strong>Ah-gah-zah-deh</strong>.
