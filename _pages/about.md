I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I serve as program faculty for the [Machine Learning](https://ml.gatech.edu/phd), [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu), and [Bioengineering](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu) Ph.D. programs. I am also affiliated with the Institute for Data Engineering and Science (IDEaS) and the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. Prior to Georgia Tech, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu) and [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), and earned my Ph.D. at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of <b>machine learning and AI</b>, <b>information and signal processing</b>, and <b>biological design and engineering</b>. I develop tools and algorithms that enable machines to learn, predict, scale, adapt, and be explained to solve most challenging biological science and engineering problems. Our solutions are usually enabled by a theoretical understanding of the underlying mathematical problems. For that reason, our group is a well-balanced mix of <b>theory</b>, <b>algorithms</b>, and <b>real-world applications</b>.

Some of the currect directions include:
<ul>
<li>AI4Science</li>
<li>Protein Design and Optimization</li>
<li>Sparse and Spectral Learning</li>
<li>Agentic AI for Discovery</li>
<li>Discrete Diffusion Modeling</li>
</ul>

I pronounce my first name <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6GOCS5fmeg&t=4s'>/æmi:r'æli:/</a> and last name <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6efdOZye2Ig'>/ægə'zɑdɛ/</a>.
